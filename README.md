# Toadkicker.com

This is [my site](http://toadkicker.com). Beautiful. Majestic. Like a kitten on Christmas. Like watching Legally Blonde backwards.

## Hipsters be warned
This website does not use <insert hot new front end thing>. It uses jQuery, and maybe where it doesn't even need it. I know. The shock of building a three tab website with that was hard to swallow for me as well. It turns out I just don't have a huge interest in doing something about it, between submitting patches on Github and all the other fun things I do enjoy.

However it does have some subtley fun things in it, like an algorithm for calculating the current time as a color, calculating complementary colors, and picking background images from Reddit's API for both mobile and desktop sizes. I encourage you to take a peek in there if you are curious.

## Hosting

1) CD to the dist/ directory.
2) Put file in web hosting directory
3) Load index.html in a browser.

## Contributing

You can use my site's code however you want. Just don't be a total cheater and change the content and call it yours.
In all the years this site has been up I've never had a pull request, but hey I'll be happy to take one if you want to send one.

## Roadmap

- Remove jQuery and upgrade to ES6 code where it fits
- Update the portfolio page to be much prettier
- Mobile layout improvements
- Add transition loading for background images
