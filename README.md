#Toadkicker.com

This is [my site](http://toadkicker.com). Beautiful. Majestic. Like a kitten on Christmas.

##But its one file?

Yep it's one html file. I don't need a database or a web framework.
No reason to use grunt, bower, or other fun javascript tools. No ruby on rails. No nodejs. Just a one page wonder.
Its using jQuery pulled from Google CDN, and I'm planning on removing that. The point is to bring back the performance
aspects of single page "apps".

##Tests

Someday I'll write some tests. Maybe. Is it worth the effort? Probably not.
I'm likely to redesign this thing all over again and cancel writing tests.

##Hosting

1) Put file in web hosting directory
2) Load file in browser.

Currently this site is sitting in my Amazon S3 bucket and being served that way.

##Contributing

You can use my site's code however you want. Just don't be a total cheater and change the content and call it yours.
In all the years this site has been up I've never had a pull request, but hey I'll be happy to take one if you want to send one.

##Roadmap

- Remove jQuery and upgrade to ES6 code where it fits
- Update the portfolio page to be much prettier
- Mobile layout improvements
- Add transition loading for background images
